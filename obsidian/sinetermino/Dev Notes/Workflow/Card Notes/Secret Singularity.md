this will become accessible at the end of the entirety of the research tree, this will have a very expensive research material requirement, and may take some time using all youve learned in previous tech research, to create the map to this singularity.

once the location data is acquired, you can travel there, but be careful, as you arent finished yet, you need to research a special kind of space ship type and a special station type (Q-FOSD Station). without this special ship, you will be sucked into the empty void, and perish.

once the station is built, you can begin your final research, the Q-FOSD, a device to manipulate black holes, and the singularity within. once built you will begin the very dagnerous process, of creating a naked ringularity.

jump into this ringularity, and you enter Terminous, a dimension beyond your measily 3S/1T Dimensions, and have to fight Ouroboros to escape.
