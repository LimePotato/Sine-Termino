## Mod Name
The Current mod name is likely WIP, chatGPT suggested a few names for me:

"It can be challenging to come up with a new name for a mod, especially one that fits the style of other Fabric or Quilt mods. Here are a few suggestions for alternative names for your mod that might fit the style of Fabric and Quilt mods:

    StellarWorks
    CosmosTech
    SpaceTech+
    NovaCore
    StellarForge
    AstroTech
    CosmosCrafter
    SpaceCrafter
    NovaCraft

These are just a few ideas, and you may come up with other names that you like better. The important thing is to choose a name that reflects the theme and content of your mod, and that fits the style of other Fabric and Quilt mods."
